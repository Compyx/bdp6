Boogie Down Paint 6

Another attempt at creating a decent multicolor bitmap editor on the C64. Haven't worked on this for quite a while, but pushing it here so I won't lose the sources and can continue work when I feel like it.

## building

Building requires GNU Make and 64tass (2262 is the version I used last)
